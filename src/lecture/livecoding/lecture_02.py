Create a calculator program for rational numbers with the following functionalities:
    + add a rational number to the calculator
    u undo the last operation (store the previous result!? use a stack!?)
    x exit

    Functions
        - they have a specification (what a function does)

    Non-UI functions
        - there will be no print/input calls here
        - these functions will not call other functions that use print/input
        - these functions communicate via parameters & return type and value

    UI functions
        - "talk" to the program's user
